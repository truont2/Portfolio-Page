### General Info

This project utilized HTML and CSS to build a responsive adn stylish portfolio page. In the page, there is a about me section, links to the github repositories, skills section, and a contact section. Building from scratch, the webpage was structured then used CSS to add style. To accomplish the layout and styling of some elements on the page, CSS framework Bootstrap was used combined with flexbox. 

This project taught me how to completely build a portfolio webpage and to solve various CSS issues. I especially learned to better tilize Bootstrap and to add my own styling to make the page turn out the it has. In the future, I plan to add more javascript and more animations to make the page have a better user experience feeling to it.
